Symptom Extraction and Medical Concept Normalization from Free-Text Clinical Input

 1. Problem Statement

Clinical systems receive large amounts of unstructured free-text input from patients and doctors. Patients often describe symptoms using layman language, slang, dialects, or mixed languages, while doctors commonly use abbreviations and informal shorthand (e.g., SOB for shortness of breath, CP for chest pain). This variability creates inconsistency in medical records and reduces the effectiveness of analytics, clinical decision support, and machine learning models.
The core problem is how to accurately extract medical entities (especially symptoms) from free-text and normalize them to standardized, canonical medical concepts used in an internal database.

**Example Reference:**
Liu et al., “Clinical Concept Normalization: A Review of Methods and Applications” (overview of clinical entity normalization methods).

### What problem does the paper solve?

The paper addresses the challenge of mapping diverse surface forms of medical terms (synonyms, abbreviations, spelling variations) found in clinical notes to standardized medical concepts (e.g., UMLS, SNOMED CT, ICD codes).

### What method does it use?

The paper surveys multiple approaches:

* Rule-based and dictionary matching
* Traditional machine learning classifiers
* Neural embedding-based similarity models
* Hybrid approaches combining rules with ML
* Recent approaches using pretrained language models (e.g., BERT variants trained on clinical text)

### What data does it work on?

* Clinical notes
* Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
* Medical datasets annotated with standardized concepts (e.g., UMLS-linked corpora)

### Strengths

* Embedding-based and LLM-based approaches capture semantic similarity beyond exact string matching.
* Hybrid systems improve robustness by combining precision of rules with generalization of ML.
* Standard medical ontologies (UMLS, SNOMED CT) provide reliable canonical vocabularies.

### Weaknesses

* Pure rule-based systems fail on unseen expressions and misspellings.
* ML and deep learning approaches require labeled data, which is expensive in the medical domain.
* Multilingual or code-mixed patient input (e.g., Arabic + English) remains challenging.
* Ambiguity in short abbreviations (e.g., “CP” can mean chest pain or cerebral palsy depending on context).



## 3. Analysis of Our Use Case

### Input Types

* **Patient free-text input:**
  Example: “عندي وجع في صدري ودوخة”
* **Doctor free-text notes:**
  Example: “Pt c/o SOB and CP”
* **Internal database:**
  Contains canonical symptom and disease names (e.g., Chest Pain, Dyspnea, Cough, Fever).

### Requirements

* Extract symptoms and clinical entities from raw text.
* Normalize different surface forms (Arabic layman terms, English medical terms, abbreviations, misspellings) into a single standardized representation.
* Map normalized terms to internal canonical IDs used in the database.

## 5. Key Challenges

* **Synonyms:**
  “shortness of breath” vs “dyspnea”
* **Abbreviations:**
  SOB → Dyspnea
  CP → Chest Pain
* **Misspellings:**
  “dizzines” → dizziness
* **Layman vs Medical Language:**
  “نفَسي مكتوم” → Dyspnea
* **Mixed Languages:**
  “عندي chest pain”
* **Ambiguity:**
  Short abbreviations can map to multiple concepts depending on context.



## 6. Recommended Techniques and Models

* **Rule-based components:**

  * Medical dictionaries and abbreviation lookup tables
* **Ontology-based normalization:**

  * UMLS, SNOMED CT, ICD
* **Embedding-based similarity models:**

  * Word embeddings / sentence embeddings for matching surface forms to canonical terms
* **Pretrained clinical language models:**

  * ClinicalBERT, BioBERT
* **Hybrid approach:**

  * Combine rule-based normalization for known abbreviations with ML/LLM-based semantic matching for unseen variants
* **Optional future direction:**

  * Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned or prompted for entity normalization (with human validation for safety).



## 7. Concrete Examples

### Example 1: Patient Input

**Raw Text:**
“المريض عنده كحة وضيق نفس”

**Extracted Entities:**
["كحة", "ضيق نفس"]

**Normalized Output:**

* "كحة" → Cough
* "ضيق نفس" → Dyspnea



### Example 2: Doctor Note

**Raw Text:**
“Pt c/o SOB and CP”

**Extracted Entities:**
["SOB", "CP"]

**Normalized Output:**

* "SOB" → Dyspnea
* "CP" → Chest Pain



### Example 3: Mixed Language

**Raw Text:**
“عندي chest pain وبحس بدوخة”

**Extracted Entities:**
["chest pain", "دوخة"]

**Normalized Output:**

* "chest pain" → Chest Pain
* "دوخة" → Dizziness
